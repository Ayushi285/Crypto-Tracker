# Assumptions Made During Development

1. **User Familiarity**: It is assumed that users have a basic understanding of cryptocurrencies and their symbols (BTC, ETH, etc.).
2. **API Stability**: The application assumes that the CoinMarketCap API will remain stable and that rate limits will not be exceeded during normal usage.
3. **Network Availability**: It is assumed that users have a stable internet connection to fetch real-time data.
4. **No User Authentication**: The current version does not require user authentication, which simplifies usage but limits personalized features.
5. **Browser Compatibility**: It is assumed that users will access the application using modern browsers that support ES6 features.
